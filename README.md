# GM-Script-ATOM

After i updated the [Sublime Text 3](https://yeinlookatdatunicorn.net/blog/20150715_1_GM_SUblime) syntax plugin to the latest commands of Global Mapper, i had the idea to create the same for the [Atom Editor](https://atom.io). The editor is quite powerfull free and open source tool. I still prefer Sublime Text over Atom because you are able to load bigger Textfiles much faster.

To install it to your Atom, just copy the folders grammars, settings and the package.json, found here [Github Repo Atom Syntax](https://github.com/zwnk/GM-Script-ATOM), to c:\Users\"yourusername".atom\packages\gm-script under Windows. Linux and Mac users have to take a look at the .atom folder inside the users home folder.

If you have questions feel free to ask me here [Global Mapper Forum](http://forum.globalmapperforum.com/discussion/12660/syntax-highlighting-for-sublime-text-3#latest) or send me an email at **blog-at-yeinlookatdatunicorn.net**
